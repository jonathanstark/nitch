Running time: 4:45

Kelli builds a rest api with ruby on rails, Jonathan asks stupid questions while she does it, and we post video of the whole shebang for you to enjoy in your copious free time.

NOTE: We're still processing the video and will embed it here when it's done. Follow [@nitchapps](https://twitter.com/nitchapps) on Twitter if you'd like to be notified when it's available.
