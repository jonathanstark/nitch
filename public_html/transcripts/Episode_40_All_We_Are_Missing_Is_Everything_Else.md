Episode 40: All We're Missing Is Everything Else
--------------------------------------------
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Hello and welcome to the <b>Nitch Podcast</b> for Friday January 18th, 2013. I am Jonathan Stark.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	I'm Kelli Shaver.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	We're here to talk about building apps that run everywhere. This week, the pros and cons of twitters bootstrap, learning to live with Objective-C and new developments in lamp programming. And I don't mean less, please stay tuned, the <b>Nitch Podcast</b> is next. And how are you today?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Tired but good. How about you?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	We got a good 6 inches of snow so I am in a good mood.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Oh wow. Don't be hit. We had rain all night long and temperature's that keep going below freezing and above freezing, kept switching back and forth between freezing rain and regular rain but it warmed enough this morning that didn’t cause any problems.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes that's rough and tough to shovel. Yes I was just in Miami, I think it was yesterday or the day before and complaining that we hadn't have that much snow yet up North. And it worked.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 So I got to pull out my Christmas hat which is a furry ear flap number. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Nice.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes, I love it.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You’re furry, furry cap and your flannel shirt. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Exactly and in my element, that's my element.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Lumberjack shirt with a fuzzy hat.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Nice.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	So I'm broadcasting this morning from the torn up man town.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes but at least you're back in it.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I am back in it, yes. It's not too bad actually I could probably; well I am going to have to deal with the problem.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I could probably deal with this.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, you don't have a choice for awhile.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	So I'm in the basement, the ceiling is all ripped out and exposed lace and carpet is all ripped up. It's pretty ghetto.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 It got that industrial look going. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes exactly. That's okay. It'll be all new shortly, soon enough. What's going on with you guys? Other that the winter conditions. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Other than the winter conditions and Richard starting a new semester at university, that's about it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Anymore Python programming in the future?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 I don't know. I suspect so but we kind of got lazy about it over the holiday. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes. I was a slack on my family Python education over the holidays. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes.  Such a loser.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's hard to keep up with all the wrapping, and New Year's Eve, that's a lot. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	House catching on fire, yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. Anyhow, I picked up our dumpster today, so we can have our driveway back. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Oh yes. Nice, that's to say you can park the car but I guess you—do you  even have a car?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. We have one car.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You just don't drive it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. I drive it as little as possible. It's actually good because it's a good I think for people up North. It's interesting, advantage of having a dumpster on your driveway so you don't have to shovel after you move it. So, if it snows unpredicted just put a dumpster in your driveway and you'd be good to go.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes and there we go, life-pro tips. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Anyhow, so housekeeping this week, first of all it's our 40th episode. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yehey.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>  Congratulations. We turned 40.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. Actually, we too.  

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's going to be, Jesus, it must be coming up on a year. I think we've only taken one week off, right, for Christmas

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes. One weekend, I think we started in April. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, so, it's coming up fast, 12 weeks left. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Did you do something special?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes something crazy. Some kind of like whacky, who knows, we'll think of something.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Is it a blooper reel. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Oh men. It will be funny. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 I hope there will be a lot of editing. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes.  It'd be, *"Ah, I'd just have to listen to 50 hours of content."* Yes. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	There's actually there some that stand out. I could probably just go back and find, string it together. That would be funny. The other thing is that Kelli put up the world work for Boston's site.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.  People should visit, especially if they’re in Boston. Yes, if you're in Boston I would appreciate it.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	You want to explain what it is?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Actually, yes.  We're planning all putting in there not entirely too distant to future to kind of relocate to that area. I just kind of like to, just kind of get my foot in the door with some companies there and start meeting and forming some connections of companies and people in the area and That sort of thing. And then I've met and work with a few one, I have several friends up there. So just kind of a way for me to sort of start networking a little more with companies and developers in the area.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Excellent. If you're in the Boston area check out Work Out Work for Boston. It serves an open letter to the developer hiring community in the area. So great and if you and share it if you know people, if you're not in Boston but you know people who are, please let them know. So this week, well it's more than just this week. But you have been working on a big bootstrap project.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. From much work from this week. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes and it's one of those classic 90% done, 90% to go type of things. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	The cool thing about that is when that happens it really means that you're learning things. Lots of little intricacies and dealing with little, maybe not bugs but rendering issues or whatever and I know that you've had a lot of sort of like of what’s s good about bootstrap, what's bad about bootstrap. Probably the dear listener would be, would benefit from hearing your experience.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes there's been a lot of little things back and forth. I will say that getting to that first 90% bootstrap was super easy. I was able to get the basic site up and the lay-out up and go in pretty quickly with it. But then we got down to some of the far more specific little customizations and kind of extending some of what was there a little more and it got to be this super tedious and at times I felt I was kind of working against bootstrap. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right, I mean that's kind of like the classic trade off when you use, I don't know if it's fair to call it framework but it kind of is and... 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, I guess that's probably the closest name for it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's like a combination of things.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I mean my experience with it has been limited to literally like I was just put up a landing page, I am not a great designer, I don't have time to futz around with it. I am just going to use bootstrap because it looks way better out of the box than anything I'm going to be able to come up with in a weekend.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, so it's like, it's great for that. That's kind of, but when you go to do stuff that's not baked into out of the box, it sounds like it good to be, it's not real friendly for that. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes there were few specifics issues that we have but yes I tend to agree for things like, you’re doing a project and you did sample landing page or maybe you're building apps and you need to play out of backend interface or where it's not a filling phasing thing, you don't have to match some particular brands like that. You just need to build nice clean interface. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Great example there.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	For things like that, it's great and for basic. I feel like it's not fair to just say don't use it if you're doing more custom work because there are lot of good and useful tools that I should deal with it. Like be prepared, you can't just like throw up bootstrap and slap on a few different rearing and diffused styles and have it work. There's going to be, you're going to run into issues. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right. Do you think that any of them would be, you know if you're going to do that again was just a question of learning curve or if you're going to do that again you wouldn't use bootstrap in this particular instance. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	If I was going to do it again I would stick with bootstrap for the CSS and for the layout. That actually worked out quite well. Where I run into problems with was using and extending some of the bootstraps built in Java Script functionality. I think I would probably for go some of the Java Script components that I used this time. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Got you. It was my experience when I played with it that it occurred to me or looked like there could be a lot of things that are kind of dependent like the styling might be dependent on some Java script is that—is there a way to kind of package it up. I think there's like a theme roller type of thing where you can say, *“I want this and I don't want that.”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Will the styles, like can you get a version of bootstrap that's completely Java script free that still works?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 I don't know if you could get one that's completely Java script free. I hadn't looked into it but you can leave out a lot of Java script components.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right. Like widgets and stuff. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes lot of the widgets. Actually the biggest problem that, the one I had the biggest problem with was the carousel.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes, the site has a lot of carousels on it. I would love to like link it to it, hopefully it would be live by the time this podcast goes up and we can link to in the show notes. It still 90% to go. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Don't say that. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It looks great. It's like such a huge upgrade.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Thank you. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 I can't wait for people to see it. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes I am getting excited about it too. It's probably one of the best domain names on the internet. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, seriously it's crazy. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Like I feel like if the company ever wanted to stop doing business they, could just sell their domain name for a billion dollars and everyone will retire. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, exactly. So, definitely looking forward to being able to post that. Is there anything else about bootstrap that's worth bringing up? The other thing that's sort of, I think I'd probably, it's probably not fair if you could bring this up because it is sort of like my first impression that I just can't get away from it but It was definitely not super mobile friendly in terms of like just like automatically looking good on phones which really took me by surprise.  

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	That's another thing too, I did have to do a lot of work on the mobile versions with the site, to the responsive site and getting some of the mobile stuff to work. I was pretty involved but it's not, I mean it has a responsive grid now. I don't if I had one initially, it might not have the initial version of bootstrap but there is a responsive grid system with it which that in it itself works pretty well but it's definitely not a mobile first respond grid system. Everything is based on all the mediaware are based on Mac's and thinks like that. Whereas personally I will start mobile and just go the opposite way with it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>  Yes, exactly. That's just goes to say that they started as desktop and worked their way back.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes and there's no like when you've got all of this Java script but there's no data support in that Java script for any type of touch events so I had to add in libraries for this thing to touch and respond in to touch events.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I noticed you had a swipe left on the right of the carousel's on touch device. Is that, I think you J.crew mobile, didn't you?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes I used a custom J.crew mobile build, actually all it has in it initially has touch events.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Interesting and you have looked at a couple of other ones I don't know if for this project. I know you have looked at hammer and I think another one, did you, were those other projects or did you...

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes they were for other projects. Actually I have a mobile app that I'm working on for a client now, one in Boston. I used hammer on it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	And hammer.js is one of the most lightweight sorts of touch aware dropping in Java script libraries I've seen. It's one of the few that I would actually consider using because it's small, it's that perfect combination of relatively compact but also fairly feature rich. Plus it's totally hilarious.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes it is. I have really liked hammer.js and the other project I just dropped in hammer and then created some custom bindings for it and for Knockout.js that uses hammer.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Cool. Very cool. We are chatting about Knockout.js. I don't know if we have, is it too soon to talk about knockout?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	No.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Do you have enough experience with it to, I know I didn't mention in the intro but Knockout.js is... How would you characterize it?

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Knockout.js it is a Java script library it gives you a few things. Gives you live data binding, which is the big thing and the big reason I was using it. You can also bind to event binding and when it is... it had some model view model pattern which just a little different than NBC and the way knockout works is that you set all of your bindings and your HTML using a data bind attribute. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. Like custom html5 attribute. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes and then you specify your data bindings in there. As we were talking about last night for event bindings, it gets a little iffy cause it kind of feels like going back to the days of onclick like. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes like in lining your Java script calls. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> Yes. Yes but using it, using it for templating and data binding, it feels super clean for that. 
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> Yes because I think it's, there's something about what we were chatting last night. I can't really put my finger on why I think there's a difference but there is. It's like— Its one thing to just bind to dynamic data to an HTML elements. I'm trying not to say static data but it's a static thing that, it's like mutable but it doesn't do anything.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes it's not an interactive component.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>  Yes , exactly. It's not interactive. So maybe in your post log in template, so any portion of this network you are logged in, your users are logged in, there will be like a little widget at the top that gives them a log out button that says, *"Hi, your name here."* With knockout you can put like *data-bind=some path to data*. What does the path look like? Because I've never really looked at knockout.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes, its data-bind and then various different types of data binding you can bind to text or for a value or a couple of ways then basically the, like for instance you should have a variable call to user adjacent object at the user, you should call a person instead. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 I love this person, yes. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, a person instead. You have friends that could buy into *person .“first name”.* 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> That kind of thing. Whenever, elsewhere, anywhere, and the user interface where the value of that variable gets changed than the interface updates automatically. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>  Then either anywhere else that it is changed, either in the interface or programmatically by the Java script in response to maybe an Ajax call or something like that.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	 It's really, it's the first time I saw this kind of pattern was maybe  years ago doing flex development. You could just bind a same thing, you just bind a variable to an interface element and it will be like be awesome because you could just forget about it and just update your data and just be rest assured that it was displaying properly because you end up with this anybody that's done. Even in this intermediate level Java script interface, you end up with this situation where your interface could get out of sync to the reality of what's in the database or in the data model even—not data model, it does not make sense. There can be a disconnect, you could be showing something that's not true. When you're doing client site development, when you're doing a lot of your logic is in the client site, it’s really surprisingly difficult to keep all those stuff in sync. Before Ajax, it wasn't that bigger deal because you were pre-rendering all of your HTML sites server and there's only one place for it to be. Then you do this full round trip every time something happened but it is surprisingly difficult to keep the interface in sync with the reality of the stored data. 

>And that was the whole point of the boutique.js that I was writing which was just to set up—I was trying to like come up with a way to throw events every time the local storage was changed and then I would have certain user interface elements subscribed to changes. I kind of like pub subs , you’d say, *“the log in widget or the logout widget.”* We’ll just listen and say, *“Hey, if anything ever changes in the user or the logged in person area of local storage then it would just look like a dumb refresh. So like not super granular but like just for that piece of the page and make sure you refresh that to make sure you got like the latest data.”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> Right. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>It sounds like a great idea. I am not the first person to have it. But it's really a lot harder than you'd think. Because you can't bind—you can’t tell a particular thing to listen for, there's no place to put the, not the listener but like the—it all ends up, you delegating everything to the body and then it's like you end up refreshing the entire interface. It's weird. Anyway I got far enough into it I was like, *"wow I should just really use Amber, Knockout or Angular or one of these other ones that has already thought it through more than I did.”* I was like, *"Oh I write a couple hundred of lines of code and that will just be, it will be..."*


<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 It will work.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, it will totally work. It totally doesn’t. It's definitely tricky and it's definitely attractive. That's kind of like the next step past templating if you ask me. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, yes it feels that way. Knock out actually does have templating built into it so you can do things like either a free list and when you do that you're scope for the next element is contained within that list. It's nice in that regard too. Yes, for the data binding, I love it. And I am using it for the event binding on this project just for the purposes of consistency and I don't hate it but I completely get where you’re coming from that it feels like kind of going back to the days of onclick. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes inlining.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.
 
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	So the thing about that is, back in the day it wasn't just that you'd say onclick and then put it in a function. A lot of times it was like the function that was inline right there like you do this stuff and that is really bad.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Because it just make it—it makes it impossible to create an authoring environment that you can get organized. If nothing else, I was like—I do think that going back to that, going back to that a little bit and saying, *"Well this button needs to do this function."* 

>Yes I know I can't, I can't get there. I was trying to be like, *"Oh maybe it's not so bad."* 

But the reason why, the reason I don't like it, I think mostly about re-factoring because if your calling functions directly from a button that are getting called from other buttons, you end up in this file maker pro situation. It's exactly something used to come up on a file maker all the time. Where if you called a button and almost the entire life cycle of file maker, you had attached directly to the script which is essentially the same thing as a function.

>And there was no way to tell in the interface of file maker pro what buttons or what user interface elements called a given script, there's no way to do it. You could never edit a script in a really complicated solution because you weren't sure if there any independencies like a maybe the situation on the screen when somebody clicks the cancel button, what am I supposed, like can I really call this script? 

>You got very complicated, very fast and became lie a maintenance nightmare. The kind of the way that you can get around that is to have all the buttons call the same script and pass in the parameter which is in the Java script. It's like all I wanted to know is the top level of the document, what happened? Something just happened. Then I will make my decision there. If the in line thing is that I was putting in my Java script for like specific to the button. So like let's say I've got a particular button that says, *Start recording*. Then it would call these start recording button function which only, every single button function can only be called by exactly one button which is you end up recreating the event model.
 
>Which is like instead of that you could just put a NID on the button and listen for click events or listen to whatever kind of events and have the applications that well, what just happened? Someone clicked this button that a current application state is this, therefore you should go off and do that. It’s a controller basically. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I still, I can't I just because of the invisible dependencies it scares me to be an inlining function calls but I guess at least in Java script you can do a project wide finding a replacement.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	You could at least figure it out. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. I think it's certainly a valid point and I definitely think knockout stands out, like really, really stands out and shine with regards to the data binding and the templating. The event binding kind of feels like an afterthought just to have it there. From a logical perspective, not in their implementations, because I do think they've implemented it very well. I'm just like you, I'm not convinced that it certainly needs to be in it but having used it, I don't hate it and I'm using it on a fairly small project and fairly simple interface. You can add custom; build your own custom event bindings like for instance, I've been able to add a Hammer.js bindings and that kind of thing.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, for like *swipe*.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's pretty cool. Yes it's interesting. All this stuff is, it feels like it's changing so much that's it’s like impossible to keep up but... 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	I kind of want to like to look at Angular.js because angular...

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes on a pragmatic level, I really like the way angular looks because it reminds me of flex, I like flex, I thought flex was really, really good but it just doesn't output something useful anymore but it is really cool. I basically approach it from the Mxl angle, creating the interface with Markup. You can also reflex with action script, I hated that. I can't stand to finding a UI with Java script like syntax. I think it's naturally a hierarchy so it makes sense to have.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	That what turns you off.  

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 		Yes, I had a lot of friends at Santia and I have done work for them and it's this is a good segue actually because I've been also doing a lot of Objective-C coding and Xcode for a particular project. 

>Here's the thing: X code, IOS development has a fairly steep learning curve for anything more than a simple application. It's the same with sensoTouch, the learning curve is steep but they're both incredibly powerful. The difference is that you can completely teach yourself IOS programming from stack overflow and like iTunes U. They're just the resources, I feel like I almost didn't haven't programmed the app to the point where it has been because it's got some fairly complicated stuff that look like the audio of AV foundations stuff with video. Lots of different kinds of navigation, there's navigation controllers and there's tab bar controllers. There are all sorts of ways that I'm trying like to segue programmatically and it's a big application that intended originally to do phone gap, but phone gap wasn't capable of creating the video interactions that we needed. 

>It's a giant screen with lots of weird interactions but I can literally search like almost in plain English like, *“how do I programmatically create a push segue?”* Bang! There’s like ten results on stack overflow that give you source codes and links to blogs that explains how to do it. Here's how you do it next Xcode 3, here's how you do it for Xcode 4, here’s how you do it for IOS 6, here's how you do it with story boards, here’s how you do it without story boards. It's like covered. Unfortunately sensoTouch does not have that. They have tons and tons of documentation but it's—there's just too many, I tried to build this exact same application with sensoTouch and I give up. They are too stupid to figure out or it's too confusing for human being but I could not build this app with sensoTouch. 


<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	SensoTouch feels very abstracted. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Oh yes it's incredibly abstracted. The other bummer with sensoTouch is that it's like web kit only, expressly web kit only not even like, *"Oh well it might work on Firefox,”* it fails. It says, *“No, you have to go on with web kit.”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	To me, that’s like a major problem for a web-based framework to only work in one kind of browsers like, *“Well seriously, come on you guys!”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 You would have to package it up and distribute this as an app. You could just build your mobile website with sensoTouch.
	
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Exactly which to me is like, *“well if I'm going to do that...”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	That's hard to learn. Might as well do Objective-C.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	There are certainly other things to consider. Yes it's been interesting working with Objective-C because there some patterns that I haven't encountered before so we're talking about the binding pattern. The data binding pattern and Objective-C has this sort of delegation pattern that is something that you have to get comfortable with where you certain objects basically delegate there. Certain functions to like the parent object or like the controller and they aren't managed directly within the object. I sort of get why that's cool and stuff but it seems really... I don't know. It seems kind of precious.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You keep making more work for yourself. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes it's like. I keep reserving judgement because I know that I don’t like the Apple ecosystem. I love Apple products but they obviously make gorgeous stuff I got tons of Apple products. I cannot stand their business model. It drives me bananas. It’s working out of them but I have a tip on my shoulder about the whole thing. The close nature, the ecosystem I feel like, I'd like to say that I feel like got of mistake but it's tough to argue when they're like the number one most profitable company in the planet. It just seems so old school and short term say next decade, like—who know what they'll do, maybe they’ll become more open if they have to. It always seems to me like they would just kind of drag their feet with that stuff just enough to remain competitive to sort of like dribble out these thing that everybody wants. Whether it's a better performing Java script engine for home screen apps or whatever it is. They're like they sort of string you along just enough so that they're always on the sweet spot on making tons of money. They are probably a company so that makes sense. The point is that I don't like them on principle. I don't like being an apple developer in principle. I’ve got to bear that in mind when I'm bragging on Xcode and etcetera. The syntax of Objective-C and the way the framework is set up with the delegation patterns stuff it's just I keep waiting to say like, *"Oh these light bulbs going to go on.”* And I'm going to go, *“Oh my god this is awesome.”*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	That's just not...

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's not happening like I'm writing a lot of Objective-C. It's a fairly big application and it's big and I keep on waiting. It's one of those things that should be the perfect thing for a compiled language strongly typed in and you have good profiling tools and all that. It hasn't hit me yet. I haven't been like, *"Oh wow, yes this would have been really, really been impossible to do another way.”* 

>It's just not—the syntax, the function signatures, the method signatures just make me want to explode, their so annoying and people say... Oh man! And people say, *"oh yes, but its self documenting."* And I am like, *“Oh yes, this looks self documenting to you. You can read this.”* Some of these function signatures are like—they're unsayable. I don't know how Objective-C developers talk to each other. Believe me, PHP is one of my, one of the languages that I know very well that suffers from similar problem but in a different way because the language grew up so strangely over time. There's no like, there's no consistency to their naming. So that's like—that's a good different kind of problem. This one is incommunicable, verbally. And you are like, *“I wish I had an example in front of me. “*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> You know, what you should do.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's like—they’re be like, you're writing a line of texts that is wrapping on a full screen monitor. That's like a function call and then there's like there's no way to break it up, there's no way to—I mean, you can put line breaks in it but it's just like...

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	I guess the idea is to be descriptive with your naming but when it kicks you... 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> Yes, but there is a sort of point where you can’t read it.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	When it takes you like a minute and a half to like read your function name to someone and say, *"Oh, you just called bla bla bla,"* and a minute later you've said it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	 I feel like it needs to have paragraph returns and stuff. Can I get a line return in here somewhere? Its bananas. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You have to come up for errors at some point. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes it's just like, it's kind of like this, and I think it was probably very clever and cool earlier in the framework when there weren't like a billion different frameworks that needed to have unique function signatures. Let me see if I can pull one up really quick. It's like, it's brutal. The names are, well let me just, *“I'll stop talking about if I find out what we are talking.”*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	It's kind of hilarious. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	The other thing about extra development is that there's this big emphasis on this story board which is relatively new thing. It used to be interface builder and make this never zip files and you could sort of wizzywig an interface together. With a storyboard, it is really cool. You can drag in and drop out like screens, you can set the properties and it's almost like a prototyping tool. You can drag from one to the other so like the segue if somebody clicks this button it's going to slide over to here and there's this, I feel like the emphasis on being able to do like a wizzywig development makes a lot of other stuff way harder than it needs to be. Like what I was saying with sensoTouch, I'm not a fan of programmatically creating an interface. It's kind of like in Java script where you like create element dev and then create element paragraph and then create element text note and then a pen text note to paragraph and then a pen paragraph to dev.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's this backwards. It's really hard to read, it's really hard to write it in any way that's easy to understand. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Slower to write.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's tedious to write. When all you really want to do is just like open up a dev tags, take a paragraph in it and write some tags. I guess it's going to be fewer characters and it's just very much more readable. That is kind of what the wizzywig gives you in Xcode where you can drag stuff out and it's automatically creating that view hierarchy for you. Which is cool, but it's kind of like bootstrap, it only get you so far because pretty quickly, as soon as you wanted to do something that's a little bit non standard or wouldn't make sense to building the framework. All the sudden you're like, *"Okay, now have to do this systematically anyway."*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	What do I do?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	So how do I put a button on a layout that changes to a different tab and a tab view controller? 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You have to dig through all of the generated... 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	No there is no, here's the thing: *there's no generated code.* There's nothing to read.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Like the storyboard doesn't generate code that you can then go through?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Nope. It's all pre-compiled.  That's why, yes exactly, so you can't go in there and be like, *"Oh this is what it is doing, I'll just copy and paste that into somewhere into my controller and then change some stuff.”* It took me a lot of like come and get my head around that. So what you do is you sub-class the view and then you can start adding stuff to it but then you're like, *"Well do I add this here, do I add it into the delegate,”  where in it's like, *"Oh my God."* I mean thankfully Xcode as an editor is unbelievably good. It is by far the best code that I've ever seen in terms of like, it compiles live, it gives you all kinds of—like as you're typing, it's compiling and getting all the compiler errors and warnings and putting them right on the screen in real time. The auto-complete is unbelievable. The built-in documentation is unbelievable, you can drag from your wizzywig interface, you can drag from it an element into a text document and have it create like code for like the communication between the interface and the controller, it's amazing. But the reason is, because it has to be because without that you'd be screwed. I mean it would be like sensoTouch. What do I do? I have no idea what to do. 

>Okay here's a—this is the function call to draw an alert to the screen. So in Java script, if you want to say like alert and then open print, type a string, close print. This is the actual method call. UI alert view in it, title—so then you in line a string and message and then the string and then delegate. Cancel button title, other button titles. It's like, at least 70 characters to throw a dialogue that says,*Sorry under Construction*. So the name of the function is, * iinitWithTitle:message:delegate:cancelButtonTitle:otherButtonTitles.*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>  	That's the name of the function?

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes that's so expressive, don't you think? That's the name of the function.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Self documenting.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That’s the name of the function. Okay so fine, it is pretty self-documenting, you can see everything you need but if you didn't have auto-complete, you'd be poking your eyes out. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Like you'll never going to remember.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Right.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Everything. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right. It's impossible and some of this stuff is optional but so then you have to send mail to it because you can't like re-order them. I haven't seen yet a place where there's this sort of concept, do you know a lot of times in Java script in J.crew modules, plug-ins. A lot of times you have created like the Ajax call. You just create a Java script object and you passed it in. It's kind of the same concept because you're passing in names to parameters but you can re-order them. You can leave ones out. You can't do that here so you have to get it right. You can omit anything. It's terrible. I don't know how anyone likes this. I feel like they haven't used any other—I'm totally going to hate them now but I feel like they haven't use another language if they like this. Apple script, that's self documenting, that's expressive, that's straight forward, simple, that's amazing, and Apple scripts ability to use natural language as a code is pretty amazing. This is not like that. Maybe someone can explain to me on twitter why I am wrong. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>  	Yes, you'll get hate mail over it.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	It's amazing how many things that you take for granted in web programming that you're just like impossible to do, that is unrealistic to do in this environment like Rich text, you can't do it, you cannot do it. You’re like, if you have a paragraph and you learn to bold over the middle of the paragraph, can't be done. Anyway, I don't mean to bash Objective-C too much, I am not a big fan of it but there are some major pros which is that, it doesn't lit you to do tons of things that you can't do with Java script at all. Like the video stuff is pretty easy considering that you just call a couple of wicked long functions. It deals with the memory, it deals with the controls, the playbacks and you can, its super fast and stable it works great on the iPod and all that stuff. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	It's not just that language that you can learn. You can't remember. No one's going to remember all the function names. You have to rely on the auto-complete and the tools in the editor.


<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Like you can't just like memorize how to do stuff and then just sit down and do it. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right and it's kind of like... I remember someone said once, I was first trying to learn this and it was back in the interface builder days when it was a separate application, you had to like create this views and then go over and do this like weird dragging drops stuff to like link them up and of course with Apple like you have a different name for everything just to be different. So it's like, when you're doing this translation on your mind between like okay, what's an outlet mean in this context and what's a delegate and what's an implementation versus an interface and all that stuffs. And I'm like, *“can I just type codes? Why do I have to mess around with interface builder?”* The guy said to me, he's like, *“well you could do that but that's kind of like saying, like do I really have to turn this chainsaw on, it's really loud. Can I just rub it back and forth across the tree?”* And that was so funny that I never really questioned it again. But I'm starting to think that I would probably like this a lot better if that's the way it worked. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Because linking up the views in a wizzywig environment is, it gets you really far, really fast but then it just strands you and you had to do the other thing anyway. A couple of places where I'd have to go beyond what you can do in the story board and I'm like, *"Oh."* It's like a lot more predictable, it's a little more tedious because you have to be like [Inaudible 00:48:40.1]and say, *“okay, create this video and put it in 20x, 20y and make it 460 pixels wide, 320 pixels high.”* And it's very like, it's like that yucky create element thing in Java Script but it's super predictable and you're like, *"Well, what do I need to drag in and drop on to that makes this connection work."* So, I don't know. I'm still going to reserve judgement and hope that some light bulbs go like, *"oh my God this is the best thing ever."*

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	But it hasn't happened yet. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Speaking of light bulbs.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Speaking of light bulbs, I was wondering if you've picked up on that segue.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Speaking of light bulbs, a new... You sent me the link right? There is a new internet kind of things light bulb released. Long time listener will remember that two weeks ago I got a...

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Short time listener we're number two... 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I got for Christmas a sort of pack of Philips hue Wi-Fi light bulbs, LED light bulbs that I put in my basement. You can talk to them over Rest API and have them change color on schedule or in demand or in reaction to some event. They're super cool and I really dig them. Then this new light bulb thing that you sent is called byte lights, kind of describe what those light bulbs are. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes, they're light bulbs that—they’re LED light bulbs with a computer chip in them that pulsates the light at a very high frequency that you can't—that's not visible to the human eye. You can’t see like that the lights are flashing. But what it can be, it can be picked up by a camera sensor so you can then use your Smart phone to let's say you walked in the room you planted the light and your smart phone can read the code that this light is pulsating and sending out and then pull up associated media content. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right so like the pulse that is sending out is a unique, global unique identifier. It’s a light grid.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	It's a light grid.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. So you might ask dear listener, why the hell would anyone care about that? I think it's a fair question. But not because it's not a good idea but because the camera that needs to exist doesn't really—I mean the camera exists but a passive camera doesn't really exist in our lives at this point. So if you can imagine, you can certainly imagine like corporate environments or like a museum or school or something where as the public is coming in they are educated about the fact that they can use a particular museum specific app or school specific app to automatically find out stuff about areas. So let's say you're in a museum and you go into like whatever the King type room, you got your smart phone and you got the app on it and the app knows you're in the room because it's receiving this specific code from the light that's in the room with you. It's really all about the location of highly specific location, sensing technology. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's really what it is. It's like if you can see this light then you must be right here. We've got GPS and we've got things like shop kick that I think use audio in the similar fashion and there's some that you can triangulate on Wi-Fi signals to get a pretty good idea where somebody's, 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	RFID.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> RFID, yes. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	And NFC.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	NFC as well. I think NFC might be, I guess it’s the same thing. Even a QR code can really be used in this way. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.
 
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Actually  speaking of RFID did you hear about the Disney Parks Thing, they are still in these things called, I think it's called Magic, Disney Magic Plus or something like that. And when you get your ticket, instead of getting your ticket, you get this snap on wrist band that has an RFID chip in it that doesn't have any personal information just has this unique code which you then associate with your profile which is kept in the cloud so that as you're going through the park you just like put your wrist against the Mickey Mouse face and it charges you’re—in the cloud, it charges your credit card for a coke or whatever. You can also use it to, it's basically an I.D. card that's wrapped around your wrist but it’s RFID. They put out sensors though that you can see immediately, it's like this gold ball with a Mickey Mouse face logo light bulb thing. It's kind of like one step closer to, one step more than like a QR code though because it's just that much easier because it's in your wrist, it's not on your pocket. There’s like much...

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	You don't have to pull out your phone and open up an app. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. It's a little bit less friction and that makes a huge difference. For the light bulbs, the thing the light bulbs did that's different from say, you could in a museum scenario, you could in the King room you could have a QR code on the wall that they scanned to do the same thing. You saw that this kind of like action. You have to pull out your phone, you have to open it, maybe you have to type in the pass code, then you have to launch the right app, you got to wait for it, you got to wait for the camera to open. We’re talking like 10 seconds to—well you might not even be planning to spend 10 seconds in the room. You're not going to like double the amount of time you're in there by doing all of this stuff. It's like, it seems shocking to say but it's too much friction for a lot of things. But at least with the QR code you can see that there's something to scan, with the light you can't see that there is something to scan. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 You have to be told that there's something there. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right. In commercial applications, you could maybe, I think it's—you could get away with that, I suppose but it's a little bit gimmicky, because you could do the same exact thing maybe easier or certainly cheaper with QR codes. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	 Yes. On the other hand with the light you have the advantage of like well you don't have to worry about other people getting in the way and blocking your access to the QR code and you don't have to aim your camera. This specific thing because it could pick up ambient light.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes definitely, definitely true. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	It is a little lot easier in that aspect. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, I suppose so. But the thing that would make it mind-blowing though is something like, Google Glasses where you've got this always on camera. You got this always on camera that is just watching everything like the—I'm not positive about this but I would be surprised if Google glass didn't worked like this. It's constantly recording like the last 30 seconds of everything and throwing it away, throwing away the oldest stuff  as it needs to, so that in any point in time, you'd be able to stop and say, *"Oh save that last 30 seconds because something happened that I want to save for later." *

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's something that you could never happen with a cell phone because you've already missed it. Like there’s tons of times when Cooper do something that's total hilarious but by the time I woof my phone out, it's gone. It's too late. It has to be happening; it has to be recording constantly. The light bulb, with a device like that it's constantly watching could easily popup a little thing that said, if it was build into the OS of the glass, it's to watch for stuff like this. It could immediately pop-up and over layer some kind of like icon of the light bulb or just immediately put some data up that lets you know that you've walked into a room that has one of these lights. That would radically change the usefulness of it because of the ambient camera. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes it would, I feel like until that happens it kind of, it feels kind of just a gimmick.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, I tend to agree. It's maybe useful maybe slightly better than a QR code but, still it's relatively inexpensive and it's done simply just screw the light bulb in. 
 
<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's it. So and there's no ugly QR code on the wall, that's another thing. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	There is no QR code in the wall, there's no sort of wireless fencing thing that's need to be said

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, fencing. That stuff works but so much effort. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, I feel like the light bulbs are probably super easy to implement but not really, reaching—certainly not reaching the full potential of this yet.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes. I think that it will be a huge big deal, once we have either Google Glass or there's maybe an audio version that's like, I'm imagining it looks like one of those plug in air fresheners that it just stick it in any old outlet and it broadcast high frequency unique code that nobody can hear but your phone can hear or your whatever or EarPods can hear. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Your EarPods and your dog. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes that was I wandering about dogs, what would happen. You walked into the room and you get a little some sort of indication that there's metadata in the room for you that you'd be able to say, *"Oh okay, whatever.”* People who your friends on Facebook that were here recently. Whatever it was. Yelp information about the restaurant or whatever. All this stuff you can do today in other way that check in basically you're saying I'm here but it's the passive nature of it. I think it's a huge game changer. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes I agree. Once you can do all of those things without having to think about them, without having to do any work to do it then it's going to become a lot, it's going to be natural to do. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Right, there needs to be—the next step I think, I've talked on the Podcast before the next revolution in computing is going to be the next poster which will be hands free, eyes free. Heads up display not heads up display but like not staring down at the ground or at your hand.  

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Or on some screen. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Just kind of a natural passive input or flow of data.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Exactly. The example that we came up last night, we're trying to think like how would I use this in my house? 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	 I could imagine if you got the glasses on, let’s just assume that Google Glasses are a thing. The glasses know who you are, you're logged into them. You're connected to your Google account. They got access to applications and to Android apps or whatever. You can break custom program for the glasses. And when you get home and as you point on the drive way, when you see the light at the back of the garage the glasses would know that you are home. You know they might know this some GPS, they might know it from maybe there are other ways to know it but don't know that for sure that as you've seen look at that, you're kind of like, *“okay.”* Or maybe you’d say, *"If you've look at the light for three seconds then that means open the drive door.”* The glasses see the light, they see that you're staring at the light so they go, *“okay send information to the internet to the cloud through the application on the glasses that goes down to your automated Wi-Fi accessible, addressable.”* 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	Garage door opener.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Garage door opener. So the only thing we're missing there is the automated garage door opener, this connects to the internet and the Google glasses and the application that runs on the glasses. We've got the light. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	What we're missing is everything else. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	All we're missing is everything else. It's just a matter of time. Stuffs going to start automating the—everything is going to get smart, and everything is going to have a chip in it. The thing I loved about the light bulb is that is a brain dead simple solution.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Which I love. I love it whenever I see something that's complicated, I'm like that's not going to work because it's can never going to be cheap enough because it's too complicated. It's too complicated. People aren't going to adopt, the implementation is too hard. Screwing a light bulb that's how with the LED bulb. You just screw them in and plug-in the base station. It didn't really have to do anything. Still this one is even easier, it's just like sending a beacon. I didn't buy one though. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Me neither. I'm not sure if they're going to reach they're funding goal.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes, It's well it's they're kind of like what can I do with this. There is a sort of a tangent but they used—were those the guys that used... 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Self starter? 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Self starter, yes. It's sort of an open source, crowd funding, kick-starter clone that was also used and was created by the guys from lockitron. Lockitron which is kind of like the garage door opener piece of this puzzle. Lockitron is this little box that you install over the inside knob of your deadbolt. It's this little internet connective box, you install it in your door on the inside and it connects to your Wi-Fi, it connects to your internet. You could connect it to your phone so that you can unlock like manually unlock your door on the inside from the outside or from anywhere. You know what I mean. In fact, if you have an iPhone4s or an iPhone5, you can just walk up to your door and it will broadcast that you're there with some Bluetooth technology. There's broadcast that you're there and unlock it because it knows that it's you. You don’t even to have like pull your phone out. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes kind of want one of these now. 
 
<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Oh yes, like that now are neither available. It's like they're totally sold out. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, I feel like I have to replace my doorbell first because it's a little rough. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u>	 Yes it's funny because our door is totally broken, after all of this funny business. I have the same thought, *"I don't even know if my doorbell works or what."* It will be, this would work if you've got that's like one more piece of the puzzle. So you get the light. You get the garage door opener, I mean the lockitron. But the lockitron is already smart enough to know you're nearby but I don't know it's almost like the lockitron’s too smart it should be stupider. If it was it wouldn't work. The other stuff that it would need anyway.  The popularity, the thing, lockitron did like a thousand percent of their funding goal. Obviously there's a desire for this kind of thing. So there's—it's just going to keep happening people are going to, sort of hardware start-ups and the kind of maker crowd are going to create this stuff. It's going to start to be money to be made for indie developer's software to connect these things together in ways that automate our environment like allow things to happen in the background and sort of augment our reality maybe with over lace, maybe with who knows what. Also either tactile input, audio or video input or whatever. It's going to be crazy.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes, it feels like we're just right at the edge of it now and that's it’s going to take off soon. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Yes, we should maybe wrap up by talking about the connected video you send me. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	I think it was called connecting the film something like that.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	It's just called connected. Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Something like that. But we can link to it, it's a video put together. I think Microsoft paid to put it together. It features a bunch of pretty well known hackers, a guy from twitter, a guy from photosynth and a couple of others who I am not familiar with. A lot of UX designers and like, it talks about the merging of Meet space and cyberspace. Like real world and digital world and just going to blend and there's not going to be a real player distinction between them and the guy from photosynth, he's a Microsoft dude; blaze, I don't know how to pronounce his last name it's like Aure Pascal something. Anyway, he is like he's like the funniest one, he's like we're turning into a super organism. It's kind of funny to put it like that but he has a kind of a point, he's like, 

>>*"We're going to look back on flash mobs and crowdfunding and these things and realize that in the Egypt thing and all this like group action enabled by the digital realm and it's like those are going to be the early indicators of the way that the entire new society works like the entire new society is going to be like a constant flash mob.”* You know what I mean just like the potential to—you can’t imagine what it's going to do. It's like the Cambrine explosion that I had to look out and it was like a cell division thing that happened in our distant past where we're like crawling in the mud. 

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u> 	Yes.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	That's like damn. Anyway it's a fun video to watch, it's very designery.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	It is. It's a good video. 

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	Definitely. Alright, I guess that's our show for this week. I am Jonathan Stark.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 I am Kelli Shaver.

<u>Jonathan Stark:</u> 	We hope you join us again next week for the <b>Nitch Podcast</b>, see you later.

<u>Kelli Shaver:</u>	 Bye.
