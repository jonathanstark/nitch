## Notes

* On April 9th, 2015, the nitch podcast will turn three.
* Three years ago, not many people were saying this stuff - now there are plenty
* Don't want to keep repeating ourselves
* Feel like it's time refocus the show topic. more creative thinking and hopefully more inpiring
* Still for nerds, but less about nuts and bolts and more
* How technology is changing the way we interact the world

From a technical standpoint, we'd like to change a few things to build up a community around the podcast:
* Change the hosting platform so we can tell which shows were most popular
* Keep shows under 30 minutes to make them more convienent to listen to and share
* Remove bug report, put any housekeeping at the end, any funny waffling after the end
* Set up a subreddit where you! the Dear Listenerâ„¢ can submit and vote on topic ideas
